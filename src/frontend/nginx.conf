# Simple server configuration for serving static frontend files.

    # Nginx will listen on port 80 inside its container.
    # This port can then be mapped to a port on your host machine by Docker.

    # The root directory where our static frontend files (index.html, style.css, script.js)
    # will be located inside the Nginx container.
